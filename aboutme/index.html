        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Cathelène, I live in Canberra, ACT, Australia with my wonderful husband.<br>
            I'm a French lady, originally from the south-west of France, so I've been arround mountains, rivers, and green grass most of my life.<br>
            My main hobbies are in art, music, traveling and good food(especially Asian and French food)! I also love crochet and origami.<br>
            I served a mission in Temple Square, Salt Lake City, Utah about 8 years ago, and what I loved most about my mission<br> 
            was to talk to people from different parts of the world, getting to know their background(culture, religions, etc...),<br>
            how much we have in common, and of course sharing the gospel to them when it felt right to do so.<br>
            <br>
            I've graduated from Pathway in April 2023 and I am currently into a Profetional Study Degree.<br>
            After completing the "Web & Computer Programming" certificate, I'll start "Graphic Design Fundamentals"<br>
            and then finish with "Web Development". My goal is to learn and get qualifications in programming and in art<br>
            (adding to ones already have in the art field) so I can combine the two profetionnally, or make a living in the first one<br>
            and having the second one to support.<br>
            <br>
            I am really excited about learning with you guys! I am a complete beginer in the programming field, but if I can help at all I am happy to do so!
